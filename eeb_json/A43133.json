{"_id":"A43133","titles":["The precious blood of the son of God shed without the gates of Jerusalem for the redemption of lost and undone sinners: whereby his great love to mankind is undeniably manifested, in these following particulars; his agony in the garden; being betrayed by Judas, being falsly accused before Annas, Caiaphas, Herod and Pilate; his being scourged, scorned, and spitefully used; his condemnation and going to execution; how he was crucified; of his being reviled, and pardoning the thief upon the cross; and of his giving up the ghost. All which is practically applyed and improved, for the bringing of sinners out of the way of sin and hell, into wisdom's ways, whose ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace. By that eminent divine, Mr. John Hayward."],"author":["Hayward, John."],"place":"London :","date":"1695.","publisher":"printed for Robert Gifford, in Old Bedlam, without Bishopsgate,","notes":["After imprint date on title page: Price bound 1 s.","Reproduction of the original in the British Library."],"editionDate":"1695","language":"eng","keywords":["Jesus Christ --  Passion --  Meditations --  Early works to 1800.","Jesus Christ --  Crucifixion --  Early works to 1800."]}
