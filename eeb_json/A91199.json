{"_id":"A91199","title":"Jus patronatus, or A briefe legal and rational plea for advowsons, or patrons ancient, lawfull, just and equitable rights, and titles to present incumbents to parish churches or vicaridges, upon vacancies. Wherein the true original of advowsons and patronages, together with their justice, legality, equity, are demonstrated; and a full jury of legal writs and remedies (provided by our municipal lawes for defence and recovery of patrons rights, against all usurpations or encroachments on them) produced; as a seasonable antidote, against the late anomolus vote passed to their prejudice, without any hearing of patrons by their councel, or lawful tryal by their peers. Whose duty is here declared; and our fundamental laws defended. Compiled for the present and future benefit of our churches, ministers, and all true patrons of them.
