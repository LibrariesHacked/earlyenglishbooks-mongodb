{"_id":"A63164","titles":["The tryall and plea of James Earle of Derby, prisoner of war, before a court martiall at Chester, Octob. 1. 1651 The articles were severall particulars of treason, by his invading England, raising forces, &c. The answer is a confession of the fact. The plea is a plea of quarter, which he conceives to be a good bar to a tryall for life, by court martiall or councell of war, though not against a meer civill judicature. His plea was over-ruled by the court upon this account, that the court martiall was directed by Parliament. So that the court proceeded to sentence, only gave him a fortnights time from the first of October. From this sentence he appealeth to his Excellency the Lord Generall."],"author":["Derby, James Stanley, Earl of, 1607-1651."],"place":"London :","date":"printed in the yeare, 1651.","publisher":"[s.n.],","notes":["Cropped with slight loss of print.","Reproduction of the original in the Harvard University Library."],"editionDate":"1651","language":"eng","keywords":["Trials (Treason) --  England --  Early works to 1800."]}
