The anti-Presbyterian tone of this ballad denies Hackluyt's authorsip but is quite suitable to the verse of Crouch, Parker, or Taylor.","Place of publication from Wing.","Reproduction of original in Thomason Collection, British Library."],"editionDate":"1647","language":"eng","keywords":["England and Wales. --  Army --  Anecdotes","England and Wales. --  Parliament --  Anecdotes","Political satire, English."]}
