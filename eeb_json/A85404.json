{"_id":"A85404","titles":["Neophytopresbyteros, or, The yongling elder, or, novice-presbyter. Compiled more especially for the Christian instruction and reducement of William Jenkin, a young presbyter, lately gone astray like a lost sheep from the wayes of modesty, conscience and truth. And may indifferently serve for the better regulation of the ill governed Society of Sion Colledge. Occasioned by a late importune pamphlet, published in the name of the said William Jenkin, intituled Allotrioepiskopos; the said pamphlet containing very little in it, but what is chiefly reducible to one, or both, of those two unhappy predicaments of youth, ignorance, & arrogance. Clearly demonstrated by I.G. a servant of God and men in the glorious Gospel of Jesus Christ. Wherein also the two great questions, the one, concerning the foundation of Christian religion: the other, concerning the power of the naturall man to good supernaturall, are succinctly, yet satisfactorily discussed. With a brief answer in the close, to the frivolous exceptions made by C B. against Sion Colledge visited, in a late trifling pamphlet, called, Sion Colledge what it is, &c."],"author":["Goodwin, John, 1594?-1665."],"place":"[London] :","date":"1648.","publisher":"Printed for Henry Overton in Popes-head-Alley,","notes":["\"To the unpartiall reader\" signed: John Goodwin.","A reply to \"Allotrioepiskopos\" by William Jenkyn and \"Sion College what it is, and doeth\" by Cornelius Burges.","The words \"Neophytopresbyteros\" and \"Allotrioepiskopos\" are in Greek characters on title page; the words \"ignorance, & arrogance\" are enclosed in brackets.","Place of publication from Wing.","Annotation on Thomason copy: \"June 15\".","Reproduction of the original in the British Library."],"editionDate":"1648","language":"eng","keywords":["Jenkyn, William, 1613-1685. --  Allotrioepiskopos.","Burges, Cornelius, 1589?-1665. --  Sion College what it is, and doeth.","Church of England --  Controversial literature --  Early works to 1800.","Sion College --  Early works to 1800.","Christian life --  Early works to 1800."]}
