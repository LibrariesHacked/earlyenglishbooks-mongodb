With a discovery of the insufficiency, inequality and iniquity of the things propounded in that pamphlet, as overtures of union and peace. Especially, of the iniquity of that absolute and unlimited submission to the sentences of church-judicatories that is holden forth therein, and most unjustly pleaded to belong to the being and essence of presbyterial government. By some witnesses to the way of the protestation.","author":"Guthrie, James, 1612?-1661, attributed name.","publicationPlace":"Edinburgh :","publicationDate":"printed anno Domini, 1658.","publisher":"[s.n.],"}
