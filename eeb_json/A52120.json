{"_id":"A52120","title":"The country-survey-book: or Land-meters vade-mecum Wherein the principles and practical rules for surveying of land, are so plainly (though briefly) delivered, that any one of ordinary parts (understanding how to add, substract, multiply and divide,) may by the help of this small treatise alone and a few cheap instruments easy to be procured, measure a parcel of land, and with judgment and expedition plot it, and give up the content thereof. With an appendix, containing twelve problems touching compound interest and annuities; and a method to contract the work of fellowship and alligation alternate, very considerably in many cases. Illustrated with copper plates. By Adam Martindale, a friend to mathematical learning.","author":"Martindale, Adam, 1623-1686.","publicationPlace":"London :","publicationDate":"1692.","publisher":"printed for R.
