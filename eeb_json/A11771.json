Very needfull and profitable for all those, who are desirous to vnderstand the euent of the restitution of the Palatinate: and of the state of the Prince-Electors, of Saxon and Brandenburgh, in the behalfe of the clergie in Rome. Fit for the Brittish nation, especially to take notice of, that they may euidently see, the issue of all our treaties, ambassages, and promises, with other hopes depending: wherein we haue beene long held in suspence, and are still like to be, to our vnrecouerable losse. Faithfully translated according to the Latine, and Netherlandish Dutch, into English.","author":"Scott, Thomas, 1580?-1626.","publicationStmtPlace":"Printed at Vtrech [i.e. London :","publicationStmtDate":"1624.","publicationStmtPublisher":"s.n.],","editionDate":"1624"}
