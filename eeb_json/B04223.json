{"_id":"B04223","title":"The loves of Damon and Sappho: or: The shepherd crown'd with good success. You lovers all that would successful be; be not too bashful, but in love be free: time but your passion and you'l never fail, there is a time when you'l be sure prevail. Maids will deny, its true, but soon will yield, if once you charge, they soon will lose the field: though they deny, it is but for a fashion, for when they do, they have the greatest passion. A pleasant new play-house song, to the tune of, Hail to the myrtle shades.","publicationPlace":"London","publicationDate":"1680","publisher":"Printed for F. Coles, T. Vere, J. Wright, J. Clarke, W.
