Wherein the Parliaments right and interest in ordering the militia, forts, ships, magazins, and great offices of the realme, is manifested by some fresh records in way of supplement: the two Houses imposition of moderate taxes and contributions on the people in cases of extremity, without the Kings assent, (when wilfully denyed) for the necessary defence and preservation of the kingdome; and their imprisoning, confining of malignant dangerous persons in times of publicke danger, for the common safety; are vindicated from all calumnies, and proved just. Together with an appendix; manifesting by sundry histories and foraine authorities, that in the ancient kingdome of Rome; the Roman, Greeke, German empires; ... the supreame soveraigne power resided not in the emperours, or kings themselves, but in the whole kingdome, senate, parliament, state, people ... / By William Prynne, utter-barrester, of Lincolnes Inne.
