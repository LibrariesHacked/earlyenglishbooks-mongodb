Whereby it is manifested, that a close prison, a long sword, a High Court, and a bloody scaffold, have not in the least altered my judgment.

Together with a declaration of my judgement concerning Cromwells unlawfull invasion of the kingdom of Scotland. Written by me Christopher Love, Master of Arts, minister of Lawrence Iury, London; penned by me the eighth of August, fourteen days before my death.","author":"Love, Christopher, 1618-1651.","publicationDate":"Printed in the year 1651","publisher":"[s.n.],","notes":["P. 43 misnumbered 23.","Annotation on Thomason copy: \"December\".","Imperfect: imprint cropped; date of publication suggested by Thomason.","Reproduction of the original in the British Library."]}
