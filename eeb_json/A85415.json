Calculated more especially for the vindication of certaine passages cited out of the writings of J.G. in the said pamphlet, with the black brand of infamous and pernicious errors, and which the said ministers pretend (amongst other errors so called) more particularly to abhominate. Wherein the indirect and most un-Christian dealings of the said ministers, in charging & calling manifest and cleere truths, yea such as are consonant to their own principles, by the name of infamous and pernicious errours, are detected and laid open to the kingdome, and the whole world. / By the said John Goodwin, a servant of God and men, in the Gospel of Jesus Christ."],"author":["Goodwin, John, 1594?-1665."],"place":"London :","date":"1648.","publisher":"Printed by M.S. for Henry Overton, at the entring out of Lombard-street into Popes-head Alley,","notes":["A reply to: A testimony to the truth of Jesus Christ, and to our Solemn League and Covenant.","Annotation on Thomason copy: \"Feb. 1\"; the 8 in imprint date crossed out and date altered to 1647.","Reproduction of the original in the British Library."],"editionDate":"1648","language":"eng","keywords":["Testimony to the truth of Jesus Christ, and to our Solemn League and Covenant --  Early works to 1800.","Solemn League and Covenant (1643). --  Early works to 1800.","Dissenters, Religious --  England --  Early works to 1800."]}
