{"_id":"A93368","title":"Soule-reviving influences of the sun of righteousnesse, or Some bright beames of light and love, sparkling from Christ upon the darke and drooping hearts of sin-weakend and clouded believers, even while we are in this solitary wildernesse, not yet arrived at the land of spirituall Canaan; but taking a turne in the darke and dampe valley of the shadow of death. With several evangelicall and heart-winning incouragements to the life of faith in the Sonne of God, notwithstanding our manifold weaknesses and hainous provocations; yea to the keeping up of the same comfort, hope confidence, and joy in him in the sadest straights, of the sorest darknesse.","author":"Smith, John, of Badgworth.","publicationPlace":"London, :","publicationDate":"1654.","publisher":"Printed for Giles Calvert, at the Black-spread-Eagle, at the west end of Pauls,"}
