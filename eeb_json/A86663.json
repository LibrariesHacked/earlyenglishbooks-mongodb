Also shewing ... there is not diversity of lights and spirits, by which they are ministred ... Herein also is a false hosanna, and a false testimony reproved ... the name of him which hath so long travell'd to bring forth wind and confusion, is one known in the city of London by the name of Iohn Iackson ... that so ... understanding and knowledge of the truth may be increased, in those that follow on to know the Lord. Given forth from the Lords servant, Richard Hubberthorne.","author":"Hubberthorn, Richard, 1628-1662.","publicationPlace":"London :","publicationDate":"1657.","publisher":"printed for Thomas Simmons at the Bull and Mouth neer Aldersgate,"}
