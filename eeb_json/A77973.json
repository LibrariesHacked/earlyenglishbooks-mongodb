Also, a word to my brethren, and companions in tribulation in the kingdome and patience of Jesus Christ, who is by the world scornfully called Quakers. With the manner of my passage through the dark world, (wherein the simple ones may see the deceits of the man of sin in his actings like the true spirit) to warn all to follow the true light within, which leads unto God, & to beware of the voice, lo here & lo there, by one who is a labourer in the vineyard, who is not known to the world; (though named of the world) Edvvard Burrough.","author":"Burrough, Edward, 1634-1662.","publicationPlace":"London, :","publicationDate":"1654.","publisher":"Printed for Giles Calvert, and are to be sold at the Black-spread-Eagle, at the west end of Pauls,"}
