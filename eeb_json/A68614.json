Or A briefe elaborate discourse, prooving Timothy to be no bishop (much lesse any sole, or dioc√¶san bishop) of Ephesus, nor Titus of Crete and that the power of ordination, or imposition of hands, belongs jure divino to presbyters, as well as to bishops, and not to bishops onely. Wherein all objections and pretences to the contrary are fully answered; and the pretended superiority of bishops over other ministers and presbyters jure divino, (now much contended for) utterly subverted in a most perspicuous maner. By a wellwisher to Gods truth and people.","author":"Prynne, William, 1600-1669.","publicationStmtPlace":"[Amsterdam :","publicationStmtDate":"In the yeare M.DC.XXXVI.
