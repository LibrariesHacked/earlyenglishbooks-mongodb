Wherein the seventeen queries (with the addition of three more, postscript-wise) lately published, partly to allay the discontents of some about the late revolution of government, but more especially to guide every mans feet into the way of peace, as well his own, as the publique, are reinforced with replies unto, and animadversions upon, such answers, which some (it seems) have given unto them, to invalidate their purport and intent. Together with four new queries superadded. By the author of the said seventeen queries.","author":"Goodwin, John, 1594?-1665.","publicationStmtPlace":"London, :","publicationStmtDate":"1654.","publicationStmtPublisher":"Printed by I.
