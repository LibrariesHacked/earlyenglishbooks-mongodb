{"_id":"A80400","title":"The old proverbe, as good be a knave, as amongst knaves (though Committee men) is debated, and concluded to be false, by Francis Cooke, and Thomas Gualter, as they were riding between London and Cambridge, and conferring upon this proverb, and many other things usefull for all to know, but more especially for some in authority. In which conference the innocent, and such as have stood for the truth, are made known and commended, and the nocent and such as use deceit and falshood are discovered, and left to bear their deserved shame and punishment. As also the cruel and unreasonable doings of some Committee men, and others, against good men, and such as have been most forward for the Parliament: some of their abuses stript, which deserve to be whipt.","author":"Cooke, Francis, of Cambridge?,","publicationPlace":"[London :","publicationDate":"1645 [i.e. 1646]]","publisher":"Printed according to order, by Thomas Paine,"}
