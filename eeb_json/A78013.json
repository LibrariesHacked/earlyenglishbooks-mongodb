Penned more particularly for Mr. Christopher Love, upon some observations from his sermon, preached Jan. 29. 1644. at Windsor, and re-preached at Uxbridge, Jan. 30. 1644. upon Jer. 33. 6. Whereby the author doth examine and enquire, whether Master Love were ever called by God, and Jesus Christ, or directed by the spirit of truth to preach the said sermon: or ever sent forth by Jesus Christ to be his minister. Being also for a caveat or memento to all others who call themselves Christs ministers, to examine whether ever they had a mission or commission from Jesus Christ so to doe, the having embroyled the land of our nativity in an unnaturall warre formerly one with another, contrary to any command, precept, or practises of Christ and his apostles, or word of truth: by whose evill practises they have caused the gospel of truth and peace to be evill spoken of, and have opened a torrent of blood, which none but the heavenly physitian can stop and cure; to whom the author intreateth the people to looke, and pray, and waite for help, for vain is the help of man. Written by an English man, Christs servant, for Englands remembrance.","author":"Burt, Nathaniel, fl. 1644-1655.","publicationStmtPlace":"London :","publicationStmtDate":"Printed, Anno 1651. when the formall Presbytery received a wound, as the Episcopall before, and independency in time will follow, if they doe the same workes, and repent not.
