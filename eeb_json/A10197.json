{"_id":"A10197","publicationPlace":"Amsterdam","title":"A quench-coale. Or A briefe disquisition and inquirie, in vvhat place of the church or chancell the Lords-table ought to be situated, especially vvhen the Sacrament is administered? VVherein is evidently proved, that the Lords-table ought to be placed in the midst of the church, chancell, or quire north and south, not altar-wise, with one side against the wall: that it neither is nor ought to be stiled an altar; that Christians have no other altar but Christ alone, who hath abolished all other altars, which are either heathenish, Jewish, or popish, and not tollerable among Christians. All the pretences, authorities, arguments of Mr. Richard Shelford, Edmond Reeve, Dr. John Pocklington, and a late Coale from the altar, to the contrary in defence of altars, calling the Lords-table an altar, or placing it altarwise, are here likewise fully answered and proved to be vaine or forged. By a well-wisher to the truth of God, and the Church of England.","author":"Prynne, William, 1600-1669.","publicationDate":"in the yeare 1637","publisher":"Printed [at the Richt Right press],","notes":["A well-wisher to the truth of God, and the Church of England = William Prynne.","A reply to \"Five pious and learned discourses\" by Robert (not Richard) Shelford, \"The communion book catechisme expounded, according to Gods holy word, and the established doctrine of the Church\" by Edmund Reeve, \"Altare Christianum\" by John Pocklington, and \"A coale from the altar\" by Peter Heylyn.","Identification of printer from STC.","Cf.
