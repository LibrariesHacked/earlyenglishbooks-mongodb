This youngman woo'd a damosel fair, and call'd her his joy and dear, but she was coy, as maids will be, and said he came with flattery. But he did protest it was not so, and at last brought her unto his bow: now they live in love, in peace, and joy, and she very fain would have a boy. To a rare new tune, called, Du-Vals delight.","publicationPlace":"[London] :","publicationDate":"[between 1686-1688]","publisher":"Printed for VV[illiam]. Thackery, and T[homas]. Passinger.,"}
