According to Halkett & Laing (v. 9, p. 32), the original work was by John Shirley with contributions by Pitts (i.e. John Tutchin) and probably by Titus Oates and John Dunton. Dunton (Life and errours of John Dunton, 1818, v. 1, p. 184-5) mentions that Mr. Shirley wrote Lord Jeffrey's Life; he adds also that Mr. Pitts was, in part, author of The bloody assizes. S. Parks (John Dunton and the English book trade, 1976, p. 40) states that most writers consider James Bent to be the pseud. of John Dunton. Since Dunton has already attributed the authorship of The bloody assizes to Shirley and Pitts, it is most probable that James Bent (Dunton) and Titus Oates were only minor contributors to this work.","\"A poem to the memory of George Lord Jefferies,\" by John Carter: p.
