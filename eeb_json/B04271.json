A most delectable new song, &c. Fair Peggy first to'th mill with grist was sent, who pleas'd return'd, but would not tell th' event; which Betty once perceiving, needs would go, who sped in the same tune, returned too; at which the mother knew not what to guess, but did her self in admiration bless. Till Jenny, of the three the youngest lass, would needs go see how all this came to pass, returns the same; then forth the mother set, who finds the plot, but ne'r discover'd it. To a pleasant new tune.","publicationPlace":"[London] :","publicationDate":"[between 1670-1696]","publisher":"Printed for P. Brooksby, in VVest-smith-field.,"}
