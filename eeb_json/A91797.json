Some reasons alledged against infants being baptized. A question proposed to consideration, that if it be an error to be baptized again, whether the punishment, some would have inflicted upon them, and some have suffered, be not too great? VII. How many sorts of Anabaptists he saith there are, and what they hold. Whereunto is added, what is conceived the Doctors mysticall frontispiece may more properly declare. / By Samuel Richardson.","author":"Richardson, Samuel, fl. 1643-1658.","publicationStmtPlace":"London, :","publicationStmtDate":"Printed, Febr. 25. 1645.","publicationStmtPublisher":"[s.n],","editionDate":"1645"}
