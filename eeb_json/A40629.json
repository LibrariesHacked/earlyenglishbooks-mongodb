{"_id":"A40629","title":"The turtle-dove, under the absence & presence of her only choise, or, Desertion & deliverance revived 1. Ushered with the Nicodemian paradox explained in a comparison between the first and second birth, and closed with the characters of the old and new man, 2. And seconded with a surveyof the first and second death, which is closed with a sepation [sic]-kisse between two most intimate friends, the soul and body of man, 3. And a glimring of the first and second resurrection and generall judgement : closing with a song of degrees, from what we were to what we are, and from thence toward what we will be / by a lover of the celestiall muses.","author":"Fullartoun, John.","publicationPlace":"Edinburgh :","publicationDate":"1664.","publisher":"Printed by Andrew Anderson ...,"}
