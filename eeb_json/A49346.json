But at a late tryal of skill, managed by the more vigilant, and worthy angel-guardian of that city, the point has been lately clear'd, and the church-men for an Earl have out voted the fanaticks for a knight, though to little purpose: for they have rallied again, since the dissolution, to fetch in the same persons. But who? or what? and how equipp'd this ensuing letter (to an utopian prelate) will fully inform you.","publicationDate":"1681","publisher":"Printed for J.
