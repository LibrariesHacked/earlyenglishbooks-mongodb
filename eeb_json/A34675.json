Hall for T. Robinson,","notes":["Cawdrey first attacked Cotton in 1645, in a work entitled, \"Vindiciae clavium.\" Cotton answered in \"The way of the Congregationall churches cleared,\" 1648.  Cawdrey then published \"The inconsistencie of the independent way,\" 1651.  Cotton's \"Defence\" is a reply to the charges against him in the last named work.","The controversy between Cawdrey and Owen is as follows: Owen's work \"Of schism\" appeared in 1657, and was answered by Cawdrey in \"Independencie, a great schism.\" Owen rejoined in \"A review of the true nature of schism,\" whereupon Cawdrey published \"Independency further proved to be a schism,\" 1658. This was the \"late treatise\" to which the preface \"Of schisme\" of the present work is a reply.","Reproduction of original in Bodleian Library."]}
